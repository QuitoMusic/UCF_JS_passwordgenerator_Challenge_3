# Password Generator UCF Challenge 3 Using Javascript

## Description

Personalized information has been a really important parameter in current societal times. Research has created new technologies that acknowledge the accessibility of security measures in coding frameworks.

This project was developed for students to understand how to link elements using all 3 platforms (HTML, CSS and, Javascript) so that diferent parameters display in our browser using functionalities like conditional statements, arrays, iteration, functions, methods, comparison operators, primitive types and, scope.

It's been a really interesting couple of days trying to understand the capacities of Javascipt yet, research has been broad above what we have learned in the classroom. The extensive operations and functionalities used in all 3 platforms studied until now, has broaden the perspective of what coding really was in my mind and, this brings a lot of excitement as to what can be achieved by using these links of logical complex structures.
